# AntMusicGeneration
Based on https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220901602_M_Ants_can_play_music we create AI algorithm which inspired by ant colony behaviours generates music.

It's suspended in state that runs algorithms correctly, but music generation in itself needs more adjustments as for now it only vizualises how ants traverse on MIDI notes rather than generating anything with meaningfull music composition.
